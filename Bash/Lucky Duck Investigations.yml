Lucky Duck Investigations:

The aim of this assignment was to use the logs of dealers schedules, and logs of players win losses
to determine which dealer and player were working together to steal money from the Lucky Duck Casino.

We used AWK and Grep to sort information and pull certain columns out of these logs to determine
who the naughty ducklings were.

Roulette Dealer by Time script:
#!bash
cat "$1_Dealer_schedule" | grep "$2" | awk -F" " '{print $1,$2,$5.$6}'
~                                             
Dealer working by time script:
#!bash
cat 0315* | grep -E "08:00:00 AM|02:00:00 PM|05:00:00 AM" | awk -F" " '{print $1,$2,$5,$6}' >> Dealers_working_during_losses

Player Dealer Correlation TxT:

11pm and 5am on 10/03 and 12/03, as well as 8am, 2pm and 5am on 15/03 - 
during which times losses were recorded by (not so) Lucky Duck Casino.
